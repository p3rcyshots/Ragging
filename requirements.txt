# --- PyTorch with CUDA Support ---
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT install torch via this file with a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# It will likely install a CPU-only version.
# Instead, visit the official PyTorch website to get the correct command for your CUDA version:
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# The versions below are known to be compatible. Find the command for your CUDA version (e.g., 11.8 or 12.1).
# Example command (for CUDA 12.1 on Windows):
# pip3 install torch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 torchaudio==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
